Hello, my name is Marcel Valdez Orozco. I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science, and I’m currently (Sep 2011 – May 2013) a candidate graduate for a MSc in Software and Information Technology program at [ITESM](http://www.itesm.edu/).

I’m the kind of dev who likes to use and learn the best possible practices, but is pragmatic enough to know that it is not always possible to use them.

I’m a curious software engineering with a serious case of:  “want-to-learn-it-all”. I’m also an out of the closet mega-nerd, and just let all the knowledge flow.
  
With interest in cool algorithms, popular software practices and sexy bleeding edge tech.
