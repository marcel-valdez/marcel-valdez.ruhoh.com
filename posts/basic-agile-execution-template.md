# Basic Agile Execution Template

I propose a starting point for teams to begin their Agile journey, I believe this is a good place to
start from but absolutely not a good end-goal. Teams should use this template and iterate on it
until they have their own agile process that enables them to execute with peak throughput.

<div class="wideimg-container">
<img class="wideimg" src="{{urls.media}}/basic_agile_template.png" />
</div>


The primary design principle for this template is to maximize the amount of value a team can deliver
during a "cycle" (e.g. a sprint), in other words, it maximizes for throughput, with the
understanding that once a team starts applying it they'll find improvement opportunities for their
particular domain.

The most important thing to remember while using this approach is that every decision and action
that the team does should maximize throughput (amount value delivered over time).

By value I mean *working software that helps stakeholders achieve a goal*. If the software is not
**already** helping the stakeholder(s) achieve their goal, then the team has NOT delivered value.
The degree by which the software helps the stakeholder(s) achieve their goal(s) and how important
that goal(s) determines how valuable the software is.


Next article I'll discuss a process by which a team can improve their throughput.
