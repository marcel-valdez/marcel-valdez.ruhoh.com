This is quick post to inform people how to get zoom in and out of text in eclipse, since alot of coders want it, but it is not easily found.

Well, **here is your holy grail**: There is a project from a guy called 'tarlog' that made a plugin for eclipse at this, you can find information about it in  [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6948374/how-to-change-font-size-quickly-in-eclipse/7816385#7816385).

It has some other features for eclipse, amongst which is Ctrl++ and Ctrl+- to change the font size, it's frickin' awesome.

Happy coding!
