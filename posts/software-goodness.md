# Software Goodness

The *Ultimate Purpose of Software* is to *help somebody achieve a greater goal*
<a id="ref1" href="#fn1" class="fn-link">1</a>. The degree of *Software
Goodness* of a piece of software is *the degree to which the software realizes
its ultimate purpose*.

For example, software that helps 1M people learn algebra can be said to have
greater Software Goodness <a id="ref2" href="#fn2" class="fn-link">2</a> than
another software that helps only 100 people learn algebra.

Note that people who benefit from software can be anyone impacted by the
software, other software engineers, for example. If a library is a joy to use
(due to its -ilities [readability, simplicity, robustness, etc]), then it can be
said that it achieves greater Software Goodness than a library that is a pain to
use (due to its lack of -ilities).

## What drives a person to pursue Software Goodness?

I believe that what drives a peson to write software with a high degree of
Goodness is that person's Care <a id="ref3" href="#fn3" class="fn-link">3</a>
<a id="ref4"href="#fn4" class="fn-link">4</a> for others and the greater goal
the software is helping achieve.

That is why an engineer writes Better Software when she works for a company
whose goal she Cares about. However, a Care for other software engineers (and
her future self) will also increase her motivation to produce software with a
high degree of internal quality (the -ilities [maintainability, readability,
extensibility, etc]).
