# Obsession is Good

Obsession is Good, specially when it is directed towards every aspect in life.

Just having an obsession towards a specific thing is Good, since it means you find that that thing helps you gravitate towards the universal flow.

However, many times this comes at the cost of not paying attention to other aspects of life, which in turns gravitates us away from the universal flow.

The solution is not to stop obsessing, that is not possible, Obsession is something we organically do when we find something that helps us gravitate towards the universal flow, not to obsess is not to be our true selves (which is to say, an interaction of the Universe[1]).

The solution is to obsess about every aspect of our lives, which will lead to us living our lives to the fullest.
[1] We are an interaction of the Universe, which is to say we are something that is "happening", like the fall of a rock or a waving of the ocean. So who is "being you"? The Universe.
