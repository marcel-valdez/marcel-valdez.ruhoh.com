The process by which a team improves is composed of four opportunities:

1. **During quarterly planning and expectations management**. When teams define the OKRs or milestones
they intend to achieve for the next quarter. During this process, the team should record the
expectations they intend to achieve and how they manage them as the quarter progresses, the idea
here is to log enough information to be able to retrospect on quarterly planning and expectations
management during the quarter.

2. **During sprint execution**. Teams should lookout for what went wrong and what went right
and make note of them so they can be discussed at the end of the sprint.

3. **Sprint Retrospective**. At the end of a sprint, teams can now look at what went wrong, what
went right and propose 1 or 3 new habits to start implementing for their next Sprint execution.

It is very important to make note that the new habits that a team picks should address the
bottleneck in the teams software delivery process. Teams should ask themselves: what is the thing
that constraints the throughput of the team the most? Once a team figures this out, then the team
defines a new habit to address the bottleneck.

In order to remember what habits the team is forming, these new habits should be logged in the
Sprint retrospective document and be put in a visible area, so everyone remembers what they are.

In the next Sprint Retrospective, the team checks how well they stuck to their habit, once a habit
has been adopted for a quarter, it can be said that the habit has been mastered.

4. **Planning/Quarterly Retrospective**. At the end of a quarter teams can do the same process but
for an entire Quarter and analyze how the team did estimation, planning and expectation management.

New actionable items or habits of this type should be things that only apply to activities done as
part of Quarterly Planning or Quarterly Expectation management.
