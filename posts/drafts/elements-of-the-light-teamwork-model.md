## Fundamental Elements

### Technical Element

* Agile-Based TOC Process to optimize Throughput.
  * Throughput is defined as value delivered to end-users over lead-time by *the team*.
    i.e. How long does it take us to deliver value to our users from start to finish.
  * Reduction of waste.
    * Any resource or effort that is used and does not deliver value to the end-user is a cost.
      * Work in progress is a cost until it delivers value.
      * Code that isn't being used is WIP until it delivers value.

  * The initial *template* is based on Scrum, but it is not meant to be the final edition of a
    team's software process, it is meant to be a starting point for team's to apply TOC to it
    and come up with an optimal dynamic process for the team.

### Moral Values

* Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)
    * Continuous improvement of all aspects that affect throughput.
    * Intra- and Inter-team Human relations, human capital, software process, team philosophy,
      everything is subject to continuous improvement.

* Commitment to Continuous Improvement (Arete)
    * A high regard for the value of excellence (Arete) commits us to continuous improvement.
    * In order to achieve higher Arete we must fulfill our purpose to a higher degree constantly.

### Team Psychology

* Trust & Respect between team members.
    * There must be respect between team members in order for interactions to be smooth and for people
      to perform at their best.
    * Trust is required for team members to *know* that a) their teammates are looking out for what is
      best for the team and b) that they'll be heard when they come up with an improvement to the
      process that enhances throughput.
    * The farther this trust goes the better (intra-team, inter-team, inter-department, across levels),
      because for TOC to be successful, the entire value-delivery stream must apply it.

## Cross-Cutting Elements

### Sustainability

All efforts require continuous maintenance in order to sustain peak performance.

* **Human Limits**
    * Rest periods of 7-15 minutes in between intervals of 50-90 minutes.
    * Provide time to focus for at least 50 minutes for individuals.
    * Longer rest periods of 1-2 weeks every burst of 2-3 months of high-effort.
* **Trust & Respect** must be reminded of on a daily basis, concrete examples:
    * Weekly team lunches where people can share aspects of their life besides work.
    * Work environment where reminders of trust and respect are on the walls.
    * Interactions between team members are done with respect, a **respect leader** makes sure to
      set the example of how interactions should be.
    * Anyone in the team should feel there is sufficient trust to admit mistakes, request an apology
      or in general voice out if something makes him/her uncomfortable.
* **Continuous improvement** must be applied by intent, not by accident, concrete examples:
    * Sprint Retrospectives.
        * Use mini-stories, similar to the ones in culture training.
    * Quarterly Retrospectives.
        * Use mini-stories, similar to the ones in culture training.
* The **Agile-Based TOC Software Process** must be analyzed on a sprint basis in order to find what
  the current bottleneck is and then proceed to apply the 5 focusing steps of TOC.
    1. Identify the constraint.
    2. Exploit the constraint by getting the most capacity as possible through the constraint.
        - Establishing a starved buffer to prevent starving the constraint and a space buffer to
          prevent idleness at the constraint.
        - Implementing quality control points and eliminating defects can also help.
            - e.g. Make sure the constraint does not need to repeat cycles for QA.
    3. Subordinate everything to the constraint.
    4. Elevate the constraint by creating or purchasing additional capacity.
    5. Once the weak link has been strengthened, go back to step on of the TOC process and implement
       TOC on the new system constraint or weakest link (bottleneck)
