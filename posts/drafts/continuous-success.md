# Success: Care, Struggle and Motivation

Success is identifiably Good because of the sense of achievement one gets
whenever a goal is achieved, not because of the goal itself, which is
superficial.

However, for a significant sense of achievement to be obtained, goals we Care
about must be set and Struggle must be had.

By setting a goal we deeply Care about, whenever we execute a plan, our Care for
the goal will motivate us deeply, which is why it makes sense to set lofty goals
we Care about on the long term, then it will not be a big problem having to
perform extraordinary efforts over a long period of time.

It is even better if we estimate that achieving such goals takes 10 times the
effort we initially thought, so we are not surprised when "shit hits the fan"
(which it always does).

Success is important because of the same reason Honor, Struggle, Care and Beauty
are important, because they are identifiably Good.

# Continuous Success

When setting a lofty goal we Care about, in order to achieve Success, it is not necessary to wait until the goal is achieved in order to have a sense of accomplishment.

Instead we can split the overall goal into as many intermediate meaningful goals as possible, and have a sense of continuous accomplishment as we progress towards the overall Goal, having well in mind that once the current overall goal is achieved, another overall goal will be set ;)

The whole point of Success is Success itself, because it is Good.
