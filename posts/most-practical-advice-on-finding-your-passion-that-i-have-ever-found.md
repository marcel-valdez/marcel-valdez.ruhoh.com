This is a quote-of-aquote I found in quora. It is the absolute most practical advice
I have read in my life about how to go about finding your passion.

I have found that I have always gone out of my way in life, to do that which excites
me the most, even if that has meant making my life 'harder' from an outsider's perspective,
so this advice really resonates with me.

Some of the worst things that have happened to me in my life, have been because of me following my
passion, but also, the absolute best achievements in my life have been due to me following my passion.
So I would never change any of my decisions, because now that I look at it that way, all of those
decisions are what have led me closer and closer to my true passion, and I say closer, because I still
have a feeling that I have not found my ultimate passion, and may never will...

In the meantime, I'll just keep looking.
